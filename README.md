This is a simple game created using SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and C++ language. 

For those, who would like to cover basics of the language and SFML, I strongly recommend the videos from Hilze Vonck. Although they are unfinished,
the perspective and the ease with which they are recorded are great.

My game has a simple design:
1. introduction screen with music theme
2. main game screen 
3. optional (exit) screen and 
4. "victory" or "loose" screen

All the elements are made by me: music, sprites and code. 
If you wish to use any of these elements in your game or code, or elsewhere - feel free to contact me on

ps: also if you need any more explanation on how the code works and how to make sense of it! 

Happy coding and thanks for looking into this! ;P
